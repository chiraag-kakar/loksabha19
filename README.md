# Unfold Electoral Roll

Analysing the data of 2019 Indian Lok Sabha Election.

## About the Project :

It is an official wrap for the 2019 Lok Sabha Election and the saffron wave has once again swept across the country. While 2014 saw parties aggressively promoting their respective candidates through mediums like social networks, in 2019, they went a step ahead by using tools like automated bots to send out tweets to data crunching for targeted advertisement.

With the country’s internet users growing in numbers each year, access to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google have surged across the country, thus turning these mediums into a potent weapon for parties. The immediate repercussion of which was the issue of dissemination of fake news, which forced the government to urge these social media players to strictly impose mechanisms to counter fake news and restrict political ad placements.

Even though social media has emerged as a tool for political campaigning, it is electoral data and the in-depth analysis that has helped parties to understand the voter sentiments better.

## A brief overview of the problem statement

India’s lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, has 543 seats in total. Members of Lok Sabha (House of the People) or the lower house of India’s Parliament are elected by being voted upon by all adult citizens of India, from a set of candidates who stand in their respective constituencies. Every adult citizen of India can vote only in their constituency. Candidates who win the Lok Sabha elections are called ‘Member of Parliament’ and hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers.

There are more than 700 million voters with more than 800,000 polling stations.

Currently, there are two major parties in India, Bhartiya Janta Party(BJP) and Indian National Congress(INC).

As India is a country of diversities, and each region is very different from every other region, there are a lot of regional or state parties having major influences. These parties can either support any of the alliance to make a government or can stay independent.

There are two major alliances, the NDA led by BJP and the UPA led by INC.

The Lok Sabha election is a very complex affair as it involves a lot of factors. Thus making it a perfect topic to analyze.
